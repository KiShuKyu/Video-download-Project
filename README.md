Video Download Project
YouTube and Instagram Reels Video Downloader

This is my first project, created to help users download videos from YouTube and Instagram Reels.
Through this project, I learned a lot about Python and its libraries. I also explored Flask — at first, it was challenging, and I had to rely on AI tools for help, but now I have a solid understanding of how Flask works.

📌 Features
1) Download videos from YouTube and Instagram Reels
2) Simple and clean interface
3) Built using Flask and yt-dlp
