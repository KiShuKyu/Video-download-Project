Video Download Project

YouTube and Instagram Reels Video Downloader

This is my first project, created to help users download videos from YouTube and Instagram Reels.
Through this project, I learned a lot about Python and its libraries. I also explored Flask — at first, it was challenging, and I had to rely on AI tools for help, but now I have a solid understanding of how Flask works.

📌 Features
1) Download videos from YouTube and Instagram Reels
2) Simple and clean interface
3) Built using Flask and yt-dlp

🚀 Future Improvements (Work in Progress)

1) Home page with Sign Up / Login:

Users will be able to log in and view/download their previous videos — saved in separate folders.

2) Improved CSS Design:

Enhance UI with a more polished and responsive style.

3) Video Quality Selection:

Option to choose video quality, and display the video title above the input link for better clarity.

⚠️ Known Issues

1) Age-restricted Videos:

Currently, videos with age restrictions may cause errors. These are caught and skipped using except Exception as e.

2) Low Quality on Long Videos:

Sometimes, longer videos may download in lower quality than expected.
