# Video-download-Project
Youtube and Instagram Reel Video downloader 
This is my First project. I wanted to make this project for someone to download videoes.
This project help me understand more about python + it's libraries and also get to know about FLASK at first I found it difficult and had to use AI ,but now I have a good understanding about flask.
Things I want to add in future (will edit here if I completed that):
1) A home page with sign in and login in option
   because this will save all the previous downloads with a seperate folder
2) A better css stylesheet
3) Video quality option with video title above the link just to make it more appealing.
